If you’re hit with an unexpected expense or need help getting back on your feet, payday loans aren’t the only way to get cash fast and should be avoided whenever possible. There are several alternatives to taking out a payday loan, including credit card cash advances, personal installment loans and loans for individuals with low credit.

When compared to payday loans, the alternative options are generally more sustainable in the long-run; no matter your creditworthiness, they come with fewer fees and offer longer repayment terms. Even though interest rates will be on the higher side for borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, personal loan rates are capped at 36 percent – which is still high, but is lower than most payday loans’ rate caps.
